# validator
Data upload validator (shiny app)

Right now, the way to try out the validator is to clone/download this repo, open `validator.RProj` in RStudio, open the `server.R` file and hit 'Run App.'

Sample data for mb1 is available in the [MB1 analysis repo](https://github.com/manybabies/mb1-analysis-public). 

If you would like to contribute to the validator, please [make a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo). You can email Mike, Melissa, or Francis with any questions!
