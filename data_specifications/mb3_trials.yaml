- field:        lab_id
  description:  Unique lab identifier (this must match what you chose in the laboratory questionnaire).
  type:         string
  format:       alphanumeric, uncapitalized
  example:      'babylab_paris'
  required:     yes
  NA_allowed:   no
  
- field:        participant_id
  description:  A non-identifying, unique code given to each participant by your lab.

  required:     yes
  NA_allowed:   no

- field:        trial_type
  description:  The string 'fam' should be used to label familiarization trials, whereas test trials will be 'same' or 'different' depending on whether the rule pattern was the same as that in the familiarization phase or not. Note that the values of this variable are all lowercase. 
  type:         options
  options:      ['fam', 'same', 'different']
  required:     yes
  NA_allowed:   no

- field:        stimulus_filename
  description:  The name of the actual sound file that was playing per trial
  type:         options
  options:      ['fam_abb_0.wav', 'fam_abb_1.wav','fam_abb_2.wav','fam_abb_3.wav','fam_abb_4.wav','fam_abb_5.wav','fam_abb_6.wav','fam_abb_7.wav','fam_aba_0.wav','fam_aba_1.wav','fam_aba_2.wav','fam_aba_3.wav','fam_aba_4.wav','fam_aba_5.wav','fam_aba_6.wav','fam_aba_7.wav','test_stream_lonini.wav','test_stream_lonilo.wav','test_stream_tisoso.wav','test_stream_tisoti.wav']
  required:     yes
  NA_allowed:   no

- field:        trial_num
  description:  Trial number, from 1 to 12 (with 0 denoting familiarization trial)
  type:         numeric
  format:       integer
  example:      1
  required:     yes
  NA_allowed:   no

- field:        looking_time_seconds
  description:  Looking time in seconds, to at least 2 decimal places. If a trial was not conducted because the experiment ended early, enter NA. If a looking time value exists, it should be reported even if you believe this trial should be excluded from analysis.
  type:         numeric
  required:     yes
  NA_allowed:   yes

- field:        trial_time_seconds
  description:  Total trial time duration in seconds, to at least 2 decimal places. If a trial was not conducted because the experiment ended early, enter NA in this cell. If a trial time value exists, it should be reported even if you believe this trial should be excluded from analysis.
  type:         numeric
  required:     yes
  NA_allowed:   yes

- field:        trial_error
  description:  Trials with the value 'error' will be excluded from analysis
  type:         options

  required:     yes
  NA_allowed:   no

- field:        trial_error_info
  description:  NA if there is no error on this trial. The decision of whether a given trial reaches the level of exclusion for e.g. fussiness is made by the original coder, NOT centrally. Please do not provide overly detailed or ambiguous information here - use a short, standardized description (e.g. 'coder unblinded', 'experiment ended early'), and provide more detail in the notes column. 
  type:         string
  format:       open ended string
  example:      'inattentive'
  required:     yes

  format:       open ended string
  example:      'Baby was calm but staring at shoes, showing shoes to parent for the entire trial'
